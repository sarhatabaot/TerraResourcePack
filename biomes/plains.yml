# The explanations in this config assume you have read
# through the pack.yml configuration file.

id: "PLAINS"
  # The ID that other config files will use
  # to refer to this file, similar to ID in pack.yml.
  # Every biome configuration will require an ID
  # (as is the case with many other config types).

vanilla: PLAINS
  # Must be a valid vanilla biome ID!
  # The vanilla key controls which vanilla minecraft biome
  # the Terra biome will use for things like grass colours,
  # weather, mob spawning etc.. And is required for
  # every biome configuration.



extends: BASE
  # The extends key refers to the ID of an abstract biome
  # from which this biome will borrow features from.
  # Feel free to check out base.yml for a proper
  # explanation of what abstract biomes are, and how
  # they interact with regular biomes.
  # This key is not required for any given biome configuration.

  - LAND


palette:
  # Palettes define the basic composition of blocks that
  # will make up terrain.
  # The palette key is REQUIRED for any biome configuration
  # (unless it is inherited from an abstract biome).

  - GENERIC: 255
    # Everything* below Y=255 will use the 'GENERIC' palette,
    # however will be overridden by palettes that are configured
    # to generate at a lower Y-level

    # The GENERIC palette is a user-defined palette that can be
    # found in the palettes folder from the root folder of the pack
    # I suggest having a look at how the GENERIC palette is configured
    # before continuing.

  #- "BLOCK:minecraft:<block ID>": <Y-level>
    # Feel free to un-comment and fill in the line above with
    # whatever you'd like and see how it behaves in the world:

  - "BLOCK:minecraft:bedrock": 0
    # Everything at Y=0 and below will use bedrock as a palette,
    # this palette will override GENERIC because its configured
    # at a lower Y-level



noise-equation: "-y + 64"
  # This is a noise equation, the purpose of this is to determine
  # the *shape* of terrain. Noise equations are essentially math
  # equations that get calculated for every coordinate within the biome,
  # that determine whether terrain should exist there or not.

  # Just like palettes, noise equations are REQUIRED for any biome
  # configuration unless inherited from an abstract biome.

  # The logic is as follows: if the output of the noise function
  # at x, y, z is positive, then place terrain, otherwise if the
  # output is negative, place air.
  # Here is a visualization of the noise equation above:
  # https://www.desmos.com/calculator/l4ytcubhpa

  # Going off the graph, every coordinate below y=64 will
  # be positive, therefore every coordinate below y=64 will
  # be solid terrain. As a result, flat landscape
  # with the surface level at Y=64 will generate for this noise equation.

  # Noise equations can take a couple variables, more specifically:
  # x, y, z, and any user-defined variables.
  # The interesting part of equations comes in when you introduce
  # noise functions, but you'll have to refer to the Terra wiki
  # and or ask somebody for a more in-depth explanation, as there
  # is too much to cover here.

  # Noise equations are one of the more difficult concepts to grasp
  # in Terra and can get very complicated, so don't worry if you
  # initially have trouble understanding.
